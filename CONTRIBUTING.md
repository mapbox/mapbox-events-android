# Contributing

If you have a usage question pertaining to the Mapbox Core Library for Android, or any of our other products, contact us through [our support page](https://www.mapbox.com/contact/).

If you want to contribute code:

1. Ensure that existing [pull requests](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-events-android/pulls) and [issues](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-events-android/issues) don’t already cover your contribution or question.

2. Pull requests are gladly accepted. If there are any changes that developers should be aware of, please update the [change log](CHANGELOG.md)

3. Mapbox uses checkstyle to enforce good Java code standards. Make sure to read the [wiki entry](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android/wiki/Setting-up-Mapbox-checkstyle) and setup. CI will fail if your PR contains any mistakes.
